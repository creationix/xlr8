- Lazy loaded graph for static content, uses service worker in browsers to look like real files.
- The graph is backed by some content addressable system that enables snapshots of past versions.
  - A dataset can be compacted to improve read access for cold clients.
    - This will kill cache for existing warm clients though since it rewrites all blocks.
  - urls for static content look like xlr8://(hash.)name/path within a dataset
  - CDN urls will look like https://(hash.)name.xlr8.tech/path
- name servers map friendly names to root hashes and allow writes using signed messages
  - multiple private keys can be authorized for a single name (similar to ssh authorized_keys)
  - names have owners who are paid accounts
- In addition to service worker, web proxies at the edge can serve files as static files
  - revision.studio or xlr8.tech can be used for this.
  - customers can point custom domains to these servers for pretty urls
